Now let me create a summary document of the changes:\n\n## Summary\n\nI've successfully implemented the requested features for your Local Scope marketplace app:\n\n### 1. **Interactive Borough Map on Discover Tab**\n\nThe Discover tab now features an interactive borough selector organized by London zones (Central, North, East, South, West). Users can:\n\n- Browse businesses by borough with visual cards showing business counts\n- Click on any borough to filter businesses in that area\n- See a selected borough badge when filtering\n- Switch between map, list, and grid views\n- Use advanced filters (category, verified only, minimum rating)\n\n**Note:** Since react-native-maps is not supported in Natively, I created a custom borough selector interface that provides an intuitive way to explore businesses by location.\n\n### 2. **Subscription Plans & Business Listing Limits**\n\n**Customer Users (Free):**\n- Full access to all customer features\n- Discover businesses, make bookings, purchase products\n- Write reviews and save favorites\n- No subscription required\n\n**Business Users (Free Plan):**\n- List up to 2 businesses\n- Basic business profiles\n- Customer reviews\n- Directory listing\n- **No booking functionality**\n- **No product sales**\n\n**Business Users (Pro Plan - \u00a329/month):**\n- List up to 5 businesses\n- Full business profiles with all features\n- Online booking system enabled\n- Product sales & e-commerce enabled\n- Payment processing\n- Analytics dashboard\n- Priority support\n\n### 3. **Database Changes**\n\nCreated migration to add:\n- `subscription_plan` enum type ('free', 'pro')\n- `subscription_plan` column to profiles table\n- `business_listing_count` column to track active listings\n- Helper functions to count businesses and check limits\n- `requires_pro` flags on products and services tables\n\n### 4. **New Screens & Features**\n\n**Subscription Management Screen** (`/subscription`):\n- View current plan and usage\n- Compare Free vs Pro plans\n- Upgrade/downgrade functionality\n- Clear feature comparison\n\n**Updated Profile Screen**:\n- Shows subscription status for business users\n- Displays business listing count (e.g., \"2 / 5\")\n- Shows booking/sales status (Enabled/Disabled)\n- Quick link to manage subscription\n\n**Updated Business Management Screen**:\n- Checks subscription limits before allowing new business creation\n- Shows warning when limit is reached\n- Displays current plan and business count\n- Prompts to upgrade if on free plan\n\n**Updated Auth Context**:\n- Added `subscriptionPlan` and `businessListingCount` to User type\n- New methods: `upgradeSubscription()`, `canAddBusiness()`, `getBusinessLimit()`\n- Tracks subscription status throughout the app\n\n### Key Features:\n\n- **Borough-based discovery**: Users can explore businesses by London borough with an intuitive visual interface\n- **Tiered access control**: Automatic enforcement of business listing limits based on subscription\n- **Upgrade prompts**: Clear messaging when users hit limits with easy upgrade path\n- **Feature gating**: Booking and product sales disabled for free business users\n- **Seamless UX**: Subscription management integrated into profile and business management flows\n\nAll features are fully functional with proper error handling, alerts, and user feedback!"}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}], "timestamp": "2025-11-09T13:36:33Z"}]
